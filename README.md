# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
UCredit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models. 

## Results
1. Random Oversampling Model - [Result](https://github.com/jamesmoonusa/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Random%20Oversampling.PNG)






2. SMOTE Oversampling

5. Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
6. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
7. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
